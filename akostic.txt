Hello, my name is Aleksa Kostic. I'm a third year Data Science student and UCI. I highly dislike my school and truly believe I'm constantly being punished for something in which I had no choice. Most classes that I'm being made to take have actually absolutely nothing to do with my career, yet are considered major-related course. Right.
